# personal-portfolio
Second iteration of my personal portfolio. The purpose of this re-design is to incorporate my growth and knowledge thus far as a web developer. 

This iteration was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Near future). I decided to suspend my usage of Bootstrap so that I can better understand vanilla CSS concepts such as flexbox and grid. I also tried semantically structuring my HTML to the best of my knowledge, and using BEM CSS class names throughout the project. 

After learning basic UI/UX principles the design of the project itself is much more elegant and simple. The focus and intention of the project is clear from the start, and the user doesn't end up lost in the clutter.

In the near future I will incorporate JS animations throughout all the major elements of the project, that will trigger once the page loads.
